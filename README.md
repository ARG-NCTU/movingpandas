MovingPandas is a Python library for handling movement data based on Pandas and [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org). 
It provides trajectory data structures and functions for analysis and visualization.

MovingPandas has been peer-reviewed by [pyOpenSci](https://www.pyopensci.org/).


## Features

* Easily create trajectories from diverse sources, including CSV files, GIS file formats, and (Geo)DataFrames 
* Compute movement speed / direction and extract stops 
* Split continuous observations into individual trips
* Generalize and aggregate trajectories 
* Create static and interactive visualizations for data exploration
